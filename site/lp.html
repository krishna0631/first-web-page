<h1 style="color: white;">LINKIN PARK</h1>
<p style="color: white;"> Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson.[11][12] The three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles.[11][12] After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave "Phoenix" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero. Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo tape, entitled Xero.[11][13] However, tensions and frustration within the band grew after they failed to land a record deal.[11] The lack of success and stalemate in progress prompted Wakefield, at that time the band's vocalist, to leave the band in search of other projects.[11][13] Farrell also left to tour with Tasty Snax, a Christian punk and ska band.[1][14]

    After spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Arizona vocalist Chester Bennington, who was recommended by Jeff Blue, the vice president of Zomba Music in March 1999.[15][16] Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style.[11] The band then agreed on changing their name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material.[11][17] In 1999 the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online 'street team'</p>
<h2 style="color: white;">Chester Bennington</h2>
<p style="color: white;"> Chester Charles Bennington was born on March 20, 1976, in Phoenix, Arizona.[5] His mother was a nurse, while his father was a police detective who worked on child sexual abuse cases.[6][7] Bennington took an interest in music at a young age, citing the bands Depeche Mode and Stone Temple Pilots as his earliest inspirations,[8] and dreamed of becoming a member of Stone Temple Pilots, which he later achieved when he became their lead singer.[9] Bennington was a victim of sexual abuse from an older male friend when he was seven years old.[10] He was afraid to ask for help because he did not want people to think he was gay or lying, and the abuse continued until he was 13 years old.[11] Years later, he revealed the abuser's identity to his father, but chose not to pursue him after he realized the abuser was a victim himself.[12]

    Bennington's parents divorced when he was 11 years old. The abuse and his situation at home affected him so much that he felt the urge to run away and kill people.[11] To comfort himself, he drew pictures and wrote poetry and songs.[11] After the divorce, Bennington's father gained custody of him.[7] Bennington started abusing alcohol, marijuana, opium, cocaine, meth, and LSD.[7][8][12] He was physically bullied in high school. In an interview, he said that he was "knocked around like a rag doll at school, for being skinny and looking different".[14] At the age of 17, Bennington moved in with his mother. He was banned from leaving the house for a time when his mother discovered his drug activity.[7] He worked at a Burger King before starting his career as a professional musician.</p>
